# TriviaGame

Welcome to National Parks Trivia!

This was the week 5 home work working with Javascript, JQuery, HTML, CSS, and Timers.

All of the questions were taken from https://www.greatamericancountry.com/how-well-do-you-know-our-national-parks.

The timer is set to 15 seconds per question and there are 15 questions.

The final page will tell you your score!

Good luck!
